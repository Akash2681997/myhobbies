These are done after a stressful day at school, college, or office.There is no rule of what can be termed as a hobby. It could be anything, from stamp collection to painting, or even travelling. Anything can be considered as a hobby if it relaxes your mind.I use to do these kind of things like listening music,watching or playing sports or video games or watching movies to remove my stress</em>
